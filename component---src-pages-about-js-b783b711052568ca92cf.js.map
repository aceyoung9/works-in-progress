I find myself getting really\n          self-conscious about whether my paintings are good enough. I’d like to\n          make my little art pieces without worrying about whether they’re\n          meaningful or worthwhile or marketable.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          And so, my goal is to make (and share) at least one snippet of\n          whatever I’m working on, whether it’s a little journal piece or an\n          in-progress shot. I’ve formatted a heat-map view to keep me on track\n          and give me that little dopamine-boost when I post things. Plus I love\n          having an excuse to make a single-purpose statically-generated\n          website.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I’m going for quantity over quality with this project. There’s a\n          chance I abandon this year-long project too, if past performance is\n          any indication.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Should you feel so inspired, you are invited to fork this repo. If I\n          get my shit together, I may transform the repo into a Gatsby Template.\n          I don’t promise to make the code extra good; I’m merely a humble bike\n          mechanic these days.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Elsewhere on the internet</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"//aceyoung.xyz\">aceyoung.xyz</a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Instagram:{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/acepaint289/\">@acepaint289</a>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </PlainLayout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  {\n    allMdx(sort: { frontmatter: { date: ASC } }) {\n      nodes {\n        frontmatter {\n          title\n          date(formatString: \"YYYY-MM-DD\")\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n"],"names":["location","staticQueryData","useStaticQuery","isRootPath","pathname","className","to","site","siteMetadata","title","PlainLayout","children","AboutPage","data","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
